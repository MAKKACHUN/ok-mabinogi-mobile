## 📖 Usage Guide & FAQ

To ensure the program runs stably, please carefully read the following configuration requirements and frequently asked questions before use.

### 1. Pre-use Configuration (Required)

Before starting the automation, please check and confirm the following settings:

*   **Graphics Settings**
    *   **Graphics Filters**: **Disable** all graphics card filters and sharpening effects (e.g., NVIDIA Freestyle, AMD FidelityFX).
    *   **Game Brightness**: Use the **default** in-game brightness.
    *   **UI Scaling**: Use the **default 100%** UI scale.
*   **Resolution**
    *   Recommended to use **1600x900** or other common 16:9 resolutions.
*   **Keybindings**
    *   Please use the game's **default** keybindings.
*   **Third-party Software**
    *   Disable any overlays that display information on the game screen, such as the **framerate counter** from MSI Afterburner.
*   **Window and System State**
    *   **Mouse Interference**: When the game window is in the **foreground**, do not move your mouse, as it will interfere with the program's simulated clicks.
    *   **Window State**: The game window can be in the background but **must not be minimized**.
    *   **System State**: Do not let your computer **turn off the display** or **lock the screen**, as this will interrupt the program.

### 2. Quick Start

1.  Navigate to the level or scene you want to automate.
2.  Click the **"Start"** button in the program's interface.

### 3. Installing External Logic (Mods)

You can install community-developed external logic modules to extend the program's functionality.

1.  From the program's main interface, click the **"Installation Directory"** button to open the program folder.
2.  Place the downloaded Mod files into the `mod` folder.
3.  Restart the program to load them.

### 4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: My character often runs into walls or fails to reach the target location.**

*   **Reason**: The game engine's movement speed is strongly tied to the frame rate (FPS).
*   **Solution**:
    1.  **Adjust Game FPS**: In the game's settings, try setting the frame rate limit to **60 FPS**, **120 FPS**, and **Unlimited** to see which one performs most consistently.
    2.  **Adjust Key Press Duration**: In the settings for the relevant task or Mod, fine-tune the **"Key Press Duration"** parameter.
    3.  **Wait for Official Patches**: This issue may need to be addressed in a future official game update.

**Q2: My installed Mod isn't working or isn't being recognized correctly.**

*   **Reason**: The image assets used for recognition within the Mod may not be compatible with all screen resolutions.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  **Change Resolution**: Try switching to a common resolution like 1920x1080 or 1600x900.
    2.  **Update Assets Manually**: If you are familiar with Mod creation, you can re-capture the necessary screenshots for image recognition at your current resolution.

**Q3: The program gets stuck on the results screen and stops running.**

*   **Reason**: Unintentional mouse movement has likely interfered with the program's image recognition.
*   **Solution**:
    1.  Click **"Settings"** in the bottom-left corner of the program.
    2.  Switch to the **"Farming Settings"** tab.
    3.  Check and enable the **"Prevent Mouse Interference"** feature.
